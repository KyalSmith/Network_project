The Python Scripts require two packages:

	pyqtgraph
	ipgetter


To do this run the dependencies.sh script.

This should work for both Mac and Linux, however Python3 must already be installed.

So open Iterm or a terminal and navigate to the directory where the dependencies is kept.Then  type ./dependencies.sh
Sudo access will be required to run.

To start the Program run the "Network_Monitor_Gui.py" in python3.

Enjoy :)
